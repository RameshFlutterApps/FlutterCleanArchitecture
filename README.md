# Application Theme

In Flutter, Dark and Light Themes provide users with an option to toggle between two visual modes to suit their preferences or the ambient lighting of their environment.

The Light Theme typically uses lighter colors (such as white backgrounds with dark text), while the Dark Theme uses darker colors (such as black or dark gray backgrounds with light text) to reduce eye strain in low-light conditions.
