# Application Theme

In Flutter, Dark and Light Themes provide users with an option to toggle between two visual modes to suit their preferences or the ambient lighting of their environment.

The Light Theme typically uses lighter colors (such as white backgrounds with dark text), while the Dark Theme uses darker colors (such as black or dark gray backgrounds with light text) to reduce eye strain in low-light conditions.

## Prominent

* ###  Light Theme:
  Designed for well-lit environments, providing a clean and bright interface.
* ### Dark Theme:
  Ideal for low-light settings, reducing blue light exposure and minimizing eye strain.

## Implement 
* You can easily switch between Light and Dark themes by setting the appropriate ThemeData in the MaterialApp widget.
  
* Flutter allows you to define custom color schemes for both themes, or use the default ones.

## Default Theme
* Flutter provides default light and dark themes using the ThemeData.light() and ThemeData.dark() methods.
  
* You can also create a custom theme by defining colors, text styles, button themes, etc., under both light and dark modes.

## Switching Between Themes
* Use the ThemeMode property of MaterialApp to switch between ThemeMode.light (light theme) and ThemeMode.dark (dark theme).
* You can also let the user toggle between light and dark modes using a Switch or Checkbox widget and update the theme dynamically.
* theme: Defines the light theme (ThemeData.light()).
* darkTheme: Defines the dark theme (ThemeData.dark()).
* themeMode: Controls the current active theme (light or dark).
  You can customize the ThemeData for both light and dark themes to change colors, fonts, and other UI elements.

  ## Benefits of Using Light and Dark Themes
  * User Preferences: Some users prefer dark mode for nighttime or low-light use, while others prefer light mode in bright environments.
  * Battery Efficiency: Dark themes can save battery life on OLED screens since black pixels consume less power.
  * Accessibility: Providing both modes allows users to choose the mode thatâ€™s more comfortable for their eyes, enhancing the overall user experience.

  ## Conclusion
   * Using dark and light themes in Flutter is a great way to improve the user experience by catering to different lighting conditions and user preferences. Flutter makes it 
   * simple to implement theme switching with minimal effort using the ThemeMode and ThemeData properties in the MaterialApp widget.
